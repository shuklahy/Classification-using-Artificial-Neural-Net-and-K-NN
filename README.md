In this assignment we have implemented two very important classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network classification algorithms.
We trained our models on the training set provided, and tested the accuracy of our models on the given test set.

##Directions to Run the Project:

*	Place all the script file in any MATLAB Environment Path (eg. C:\Users\Hitendra\Documents\MATLAB)
*	Extract data so that you have the folders 'Human Activity Recognition' and 'VidTIMIT' in same directory as script file
*	Run Code at MATLAB prompt as
>> Problem1
>> Problem2a 
>> Problem2b
